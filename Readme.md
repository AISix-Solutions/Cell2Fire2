# Cell2Fire: A Cell Based Forest Fire Growth Model  C++/Python
## Cristobal Pais, Jaime Carrasco, David Martell, David L. Woodruff, Andres Weintraub
Cell2Fire is a new cell-based forest and wildland landscape fire spread simulator.
The fire environment is characterized by partitioning the landscape into a large number of homogeneous cells and specifying the fuel, weather, fuel moisture and topography attributes of each cell.
Fire spread within each cell is assumed to be elliptical and governed by spread rates predicted by any independent fire spread model (e.g. the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System).
Cell2Fire exploits parallel computation methods which allows users to run large-scale simulations in short periods of time.
It includes powerful statistical, graphical output, and spatial analysis features to facilitate the display and analysis of projected fire growth.
